# kthaisociety/frontend

Next-generation frontend for KTH AI Society website.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Code Structure & Best Practices

### Folder Structure

- `src/app/`: Contains Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - Only page components (`page.tsx`) and layout components (`layout.tsx`) should be here
  - No reusable components should be placed in this directory
- `src/components/`: Contains all reusable React components
  - `ui/`: UI components (buttons, forms, etc.) - mostly from shadcn/ui
  - `dashboard/`, `home/`, etc.: Feature-specific components
  - Each primary component should be in its own folder with an `index.tsx` for exporting and sub-components can have file names
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions and configuration
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions

e.g. of how to structure components:

```tsx
// src/components/home/index.tsx
export function Homepage() {
  return <div>Home</div>;
}
```

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
import { Homepage } from "@/components/home";

export default Homepage;
```

### ESLint & TypeScript Best Practices

- Use named exports instead of default exports for components (except for page/layout components)
- Use TypeScript for type safety - avoid using `any` type
- Use consistent type imports with `import type { ... } from '...'`
- Use React function components with explicit return types
- Use path aliases (`@/components/...`) for imports
- UI components from shadcn have special ESLint exceptions to accommodate their patterns

See [eslint.config.mjs](eslint.config.mjs) for more details.

### Component Guidelines

- Create client components with the `"use client"` directive when they use hooks or browser APIs
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define component props
- Use custom hooks to extract complex logic from components
- For data fetching components, separate the data fetching logic from the presentation

## Git Workflow

This project adheres to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. This is to ensure that the project is easily maintainable and that the commit history is clean and easy to understand.

### Complete Workflow: From Issue to Merged PR

1. **Issue Assignment**

   - Assign yourself to an issue from our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/kthaisociety/projects/2)
   - Team members can self-assign issues or may be tasked with specific issues during workshops/meetings

2. **Project Management**

   - Ensure the issue is added to our [project view](https://github.com/orgs/kthaisociety/projects/2)
   - Update the issue status to "In Progress" when you start working on it

3. **Branch Creation & Development**

   - Check out the project locally
   - Name your branch either `issue-X` (where X is the issue number) or use GitHub's "Create a branch" feature
   - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages
   - Include `fixes #X` in your commit message if it fixes issue X
   - Example commit message:

     ```text
     ci: add deployment notification to Mattermost

     * notify on mattermost upon deployment

     fixes #17
     ```

4. **Pull Request Creation**

   - Create a pull request when your work is ready for review
   - Use "Draft Pull Request" if you want early feedback but the work is not yet complete

5. **Code Review Process**

   - Request reviews in the team Mattermost channel
   - Primary reviewer is typically the Head of IT
   - The review process may involve multiple rounds of feedback and changes
   - It is generally the responsibility of the PR creator to merge once approved
   - Coordinate with Head of IT before merging if it triggers a production deployment
   - All merges should be squashed

6. **Showcase**
   - Present your completed work during the next team meeting
