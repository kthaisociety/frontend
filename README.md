# kthaisociety/frontend

Next-generation frontend for KTH AI Society website.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Git Workflow

This project adhers to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. This is to ensure that the project is easily maintainable and that the commit history is clean and easy to understand.
